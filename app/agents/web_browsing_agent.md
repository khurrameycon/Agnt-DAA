When you choose between multi-agent mode and single-agent mode in your WebBrowsingAgent, there's a significant difference in how the system handles web browsing tasks:
Single-Agent Mode (Multi-agent unchecked)
In single-agent mode:

One Agent Does Everything: A single CodeAgent handles the entire task from start to finish.
Direct Approach: The agent receives your query, plans what to do, searches the web, visits websites, extracts information, and summarizes findings - all in one continuous process.
System Behavior: Behind the scenes, the system:

Creates one CodeAgent with all available tools
Passes your entire query to this agent
The agent uses its internal reasoning to decide when to search, when to visit sites, etc.
Returns a single response that represents its complete workflow


Pros and Cons:

Simpler and potentially faster for straightforward queries
Might be less thorough for complex research tasks
Response quality depends on how well the agent balances planning and execution



Multi-Agent Mode (Multi-agent checked)
In multi-agent mode:

Specialized Agents: The system creates three different agents, each with a specialized role:

Planner Agent: Focuses only on creating a detailed research plan
Browser Agent: Specializes in executing the plan and gathering information
Summary Agent: Specializes in synthesizing and presenting the findings


Sequential Workflow: The system explicitly runs these agents in sequence, with each agent's output becoming the next agent's input:

First, the planner creates a detailed plan
Then, the browser follows the plan step by step
Finally, the summary agent organizes all the information


System Behavior: Behind the scenes, the system:

Runs each agent separately in a coordinated sequence
Carefully formats the input for each agent to include previous agents' outputs
Combines all three agents' outputs into one comprehensive response


Pros and Cons:

More thorough and methodical for complex research tasks
Each step gets focused attention from a specialized agent
May take longer to complete, as it's running three separate processes
Usually produces more comprehensive and better-organized results



Why This Matters
The multi-agent approach follows a human-like research process: first planning a strategy, then gathering information according to that plan, and finally organizing and presenting the findings. This separation of concerns tends to produce better results for complex research tasks, as each agent can focus exclusively on its specialized role.
The code reflects this difference by either creating one agent with all capabilities or creating three separate agents and manually orchestrating their interactions in a sequential workflow.
